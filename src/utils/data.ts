    id: 'manufacturing-location',
    question: 'Where are plumbuses made?',
    answer: 'All authentic plumbuses are manufactured in dimension C-137 using traditional schlami techniques passed down through generations. We also have backup facilities in dimensions J19-Zeta-7 and 35-C, but C-137 remains our primary manufacturing hub because that\'s where Rick perfected the process.'
